50.114.168.136,25,"Comcast Cable Communications, LLC",,https://www.speedguide.net/port.php?port=25,25,tcp,SMTP,"SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol). Many worms contain their own SMTP engine and use it to propagate by mass-mailing the payload, often also spoofing the ""From: ..."" field in emails. If you are not running a mail server that you're aware of, there is a possibility your system is infected.



Integer overflow in Apple Safari [CVE-2010-1099], Arora [CVE-2010-1100], Alexander Clauss iCab [CVE-2010-1101], OmniWeb [CVE-2010-1102], Stainless [CVE-2010-1103] allows remote attackers to bypass intended port restrictions on outbound TCP connections via a port number outside the range of the unsigned short data type, as demonstrated by a value of 65561 for TCP port 25.



List of some trojan horses/backdoors that use this port: Ajan, Antigen, Barok, Email Password Sender - EPS, EPS II, Gip, Gris, Happy99, Hpteam mail, Hybris, I love you, Kuang2, Magic Horse, MBT (Mail Bombing Trojan), Moscow Email trojan, Naebi, NewApt worm, ProMail trojan, Shtirlitz, Stealth, Tapiras, Terminator, WinPC, WinSpy, Aji, Email Worms, Haebu Coceda, Loveletter, Neabi, Shtrilitz.

W32.Sober.I@mm [Symantec-2004-111900-1451-99] (2004.11.19) - mass-mailing worm that uses its own SMTP engine. Affects all current Windows versions. Checks network connectivity by contacting a NTP server on port 37/tcp.

Trojan.Mitglieder.R [Symantec-2005-070117-2559-99] (2005.07.01) - trojan with backdoor capabilities. It runs a SOCKS4 proxy server and periodically contacts websites with information about the compromised computer. Attempts to open a back door on port 9040/tcp. Might also initiate a SMTP spam relay server on port 25/tcp.

W32.Beagle.CX@mm [Symantec-2005-121511-1751-99] (2005.12.15) - mass-mailing worm that uses its own SMTP engine to spread Trojan.Lodear.E [Symantec-2005-110111-3344-99]. Also opens a backdoor on port 80/tcp and lowers security settings on the compromised computer.

Backdoor.Rustock [Symantec-2006-060111-5747-99] (2006.06.01) - backdoor program that allows the compromised computer to be used as a proxy, uses rootkit techniques to hide its files and registry entries.



NJStar Communicator is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow, caused by improper bounds checking by the MiniSMTP server when processing packets. By sending a specially-crafted request to TCP port 25, a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system or cause the application to crash.

A privilege escalation vulnerability in the Secure Shell (SSH) subsystem in the StarOS operating system for Cisco ASR 5000 Series, ASR 5500 Series, ASR 5700 Series devices, and Cisco Virtualized Packet Core could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to gain unrestricted, root shell access. The vulnerability is due to missing input validation of parameters passed during SSH or SFTP login. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing crafted user input to the SSH or SFTP command-line interface (CLI) during SSH or SFTP login. An exploit could allow an authenticated attacker to gain root privileges access on the router. Note: Only traffic directed to the affected system can be used to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability can be triggered via both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic. An established TCP connection toward port 22, the SSH default port, is needed to perform the attack. The attacker must have valid credentials to login to the system via SSH or SFTP. The following products have been confirmed to be vulnerable: Cisco ASR 5000/5500/5700 Series devices running StarOS after 17.7.0 and prior to 18.7.4, 19.5, and 20.2.3 with SSH configured are vulnerable. Cisco Virtualized Packet Core - Single Instance (VPC-SI) and Distributed Instance (VPC-DI) devices running StarOS prior to N4.2.7 (19.3.v7) and N4.7 (20.2.v0) with SSH configured are vulnerable.

Honeywell ControlEdge through R151.1 uses Hard-coded Credentials. According to FSCT-2022-0056, there is a Honeywell ControlEdge hardcoded credentials issue. The affected components are characterized as: SSH. The potential impact is: Remote code execution, manipulate configuration, denial of service. The Honeywell ControlEdge PLC and RTU product line exposes an SSH service on port 22/TCP. Login as root to this service is permitted and credentials for the root user are hardcoded without automatically changing them upon first commissioning. The credentials for the SSH service are hardcoded in the firmware. The credentials grant an attacker access to a root shell on the PLC/RTU, allowing for remote code execution, configuration manipulation and denial of service.

Port is often probed, it can be used to fingerprint the Nix OS, and to obtain information about available services. Port used with NFS, NIS, or any rpc-based service.



Port 111 was designed by the Sun Microsystems as a component of their Network File System. It is also known as Open Network Computing Remote Procedure Call (ONC RPC). Port 111 is a port mapper with similar functions to Microsoft's port 135 or DCOM DCE.



Security Concerns: Provides rpc port map without auth, has no filtering or logging, rpcinfo probes can quickly find your Unix hosts. Shut down portmapper on any hosts not requiring rpcs, ensure it is blocked at net perimeters.

On Junos OS, rpcbind should only be listening to port 111 on the internal routing instance (IRI). External packets destined to port 111 should be dropped. Due to an information leak vulnerability, responses were being generated from the source address of the management interface (e.g. fxp0) thus disclosing internal addressing and existence of the management interface itself. A high rate of crafted packets destined to port 111 may also lead to a partial Denial of Service (DoS). Note: Systems with fxp0 disabled or unconfigured are not vulnerable to this issue.

They utilize the Omron FINS (9600/TCP) protocol for engineering purposes, including downloading projects and control logic to the PLC. This protocol has authentication flaws as reported in FSCT-2022-0057. Control logic is downloaded to PLC volatile memory using the FINS Program Area Read and Program Area Write commands or to non-volatile memory using other commands from where it can be loaded into volatile memory for execution. The logic that is loaded into and executed from the user program area exists in compiled object code form. Upon execution, these object codes are first passed to a dedicated ASIC that determines whether the object code is to be executed by the ASIC or the microprocessor. In the former case, the object code is interpreted by the ASIC whereas in the latter case the object code is passed to the microprocessor for object code interpretation by a ROM interpreter. In the abnormal case where the object code cannot be handled by either, an abnormal condition is triggered and the PLC is halted. The logic that is downloaded to the PLC does not seem to be cryptographically authenticated, thus allowing an attacker to manipulate transmitted object code to the PLC and either execute arbitrary object code commands on the ASIC or on the microprocessor interpreter.

Trojans using this port: Backdoor.Win32.Agent.cdm [Symantec-2005-050114-4234-99], TSPY_AGENT.ADDQ



This port is vulnerable to Denial of Service Attack Against Windows NT Terminal Server. A remote attacker can quickly cause a server to reach full memory utilization by creating a large number of normal TCP connections to port 3389.  Individual connections will timeout, but a low bandwidth

continuous attack will maintain a terminal server at maximum memory utilization and prevent new connections from a legitimate source from taking place.  Legitimate new connections will fail at this point with an error of either a connection timeout, or the terminal server has ended the connection.

HEUR.Backdoor.Win32.Generic / Unauthenticated Open Proxy - the backdoor creates a Windows service backed by an executable named ""1314.exe"", it lives under C:\WINDOWS and listens on TCP ports 1080 and 8080. Third-party adversaries who can connect to the infected system can relay requests from the original connection to the destination and then back to the origination system. Attackers may then be able to launch attacks, download files or port scan third party systems and it will appear as the attacks originated from that infected host. The relay does not require authentication or any special User-agent check and leverages the HTTP Host header in the request to connect to third-party systems.

A non-privileged user of the Siemens web application RUGGEDCOM NMS < V1.2 on port 8080/TCP and 8081/TCP could perform a persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack, potentially resulting in obtaining administrative permissions.

References: [CVE-2017-2683], [BID-96455]



The Siemens web application RUGGEDCOM NMS < V1.2 on port 8080/TCP and 8081/TCP could allow a remote attacker to perform a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack, potentially allowing an attacker to execute administrative operations, provided the targeted user has an active session and is induced to trigger a malicious request.

References: [CVE-2017-2682], [BID-96458]



FreeSWITCH through 1.8.2, when mod_xml_rpc is enabled, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via the api/system or txtapi/system (or api/bg_system or txtapi/bg_system) query string on TCP port 8080, as demonstrated by an api/system?calc URI. This can also be exploited via CSRF. Alternatively, the default password of works for the freeswitch account can sometimes be used.

References: [CVE-2018-19911]



HEUR.Backdoor.Win32.Generic / Unauthenticated Open Proxy - the backdoor creates a Windows service backed by an executable named ""1314.exe"", it lives under C:\WINDOWS and listens on TCP ports 1080 and 8080. Third-party adversaries who can connect to the infected system can relay requests from the original connection to the destination and then back to the origination system. Attackers may then be able to launch attacks, download files or port scan third party systems and it will appear as the attacks originated from that infected host. The relay does not require authentication or any special User-agent check and leverages the HTTP Host header in the request to connect to third-party systems.

1) Run replay attacks using captured OTP and Kerberos tickets before they expire.

2) Stop security-related cron jobs from running or cause them to run at incorrect times.

3) Make system and audit logs unreliable since time is alterable.
